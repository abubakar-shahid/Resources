(A-B) The code ensures that only one roommate enters their critical section at a time and prevents both from buying milk simultaneously. However, the code lacks
proper synchronization mechanisms and doesn't guarantee fairness and bounded waiting. In certain situations, one of the roommates may have the opportunity to
purchase milk repeatedly while the other is kept waiting indefinitely. Fairness is necessary to ensure that all processes have a chance to access the critical section.
Although the code is designed to prevent simultaneous access to the critical section, it doesn't eliminate the possibility of race conditions entirely. The "NoteA"
and "NoteB" flags are used to coordinate access, a race condition can occur when both are set to TRUE simultaneously and enter the critical section at the same time.
This scenario requires an additional check to ensure mutual exclusion.

(C) Following is the modified solution using locks or semaphores, that satisfy the three necessary conditions of the critical section problem:-

// Synchronization primitives
Semaphore mutex = 1;
Semaphore roommatesReady = 0;

// Roommate A
while (true) {
    // Enter the critical section
    wait(mutex);
    if (NoMilk) {
        BuyMilk();
    }
    // Exit the critical section
    signal(mutex);
    // Signal that A is ready
    signal(roommatesReady);
}

// Roommate B
while (true) {
    // Enter the critical section
    wait(mutex);
    if (NoMilk) {
        BuyMilk();
    }
    // Exit the critical section
    signal(mutex);
    // Signal that B is ready
    signal(roommatesReady);
}

In this solution, the roommates take turns buying milk, ensuring mutual exclusion. They also signal when they are done, which allows the other roommate to enter
the critical section, addressing the issue of progress. Bounded waiting is satisfied as well, as roommates take turns and do not enter an infinite loop.

The two code snippets you provided have a subtle difference in the placement of the `pthread_join` calls. This difference leads to different behaviors and outputs.
Let's analyze each of them:

1. With `pthread_join` inside the loop:

Output:
main: creating thread 000
Hello world! Function calling, 000
main: creating thread 001
Hello world! Function calling, 001
main: creating thread 002
Hello world! Function calling, 002
main: creating thread 003
Hello world! Function calling, 003
main: creating thread 004
Hello world! Function calling, 004
main: creating thread 005
Hello world! Function calling, 005
main: creating thread 006
Hello world! Function calling, 006
main: creating thread 007
Hello world! Function calling, 007

Justification: In this code, you create a thread and immediately wait for it to finish using `pthread_join` inside the loop. As a result, each thread is created and joins
before the next thread is created. This means that all threads run sequentially in the order they are created, and you see the "Hello world!" messages from each
thread in the order of creation.

2. With `pthread_join` outside the loop:

Output:
main: creating thread 000
main: creating thread 001
main: creating thread 002
main: creating thread 003
main: creating thread 004
main: creating thread 005
main: creating thread 006
main: creating thread 007
Hello world! Function calling, 000
Hello world! Function calling, 001
Hello world! Function calling, 002
Hello world! Function calling, 003
Hello world! Function calling, 004
Hello world! Function calling, 005
Hello world! Function calling, 006
Hello world! Function calling, 007

Justification: In this code, you create all threads in the first loop and then wait for each of them to complete in the second loop. This allows all threads to start
executing concurrently. However, the `pthread_join` calls in the second loop make the main thread wait for each thread to complete before proceeding. As a result,
the "Hello world!" messages appear in a random order as threads execute concurrently but finish in the order they were joined.

A- Let's analyze whether the provided solution satisfies the necessary or optional requirements of the critical section problem conditions:

1. Mutual Exclusion: Yes, the solution satisfies mutual exclusion. The use of the `test-and-set` operation and the `lock` variable ensures that only one process can enter
the critical section at a time.

2. Progress: The solution also satisfies progress. When a process is waiting for the critical section and another process is inside the critical section, the waiting process
 will keep trying to acquire the lock. Eventually, it will succeed when the process inside the critical section leaves, ensuring progress.

3. Bounded Waiting: The solution satisfies bounded waiting. The while loop in lines 10 ensures that processes waiting for the critical section will be granted access in
a round-robin fashion. This guarantees that no process will be starved indefinitely.

So, the solution satisfies all three necessary conditions of the critical section problem.

B- The purpose of the while loop in line 6 is to implement busy-waiting, also known as spin-lock. This loop is used to acquire the lock using the `test-and-set`
operation. The loop continues to check the `lock` until it successfully sets the `lock` to TRUE (indicating that the process has acquired the lock) and `waiting[i]` is
FALSE (indicating that the process is not already in the queue to enter the critical section).

C- The purpose of the while loop in line 10 is to implement the logic for selecting the next process to enter the critical section. This loop searches for the next
process (represented by `j`) in a round-robin fashion. It ensures that the processes waiting for the critical section are granted access in a fair manner and that no
process is starved. The loop continues until it finds a process that is waiting (i.e., `waiting[j]` is TRUE), and when it finds such a process, it allows it to proceed into
the critical section. If it doesn't find any waiting process (all `waiting[j]` are FALSE), it releases the lock (`lock = FALSE`) to allow other processes to try to enter the
critical section.
